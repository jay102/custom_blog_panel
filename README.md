# custom_blog_panel
A custom blog panel which powers the Blog on my personal react website. 
Developed with a TypeScript/JavaScript backend and a React Admin Dashboard.

Database used was postgres and ORM used was sequelize.
It has minimal features such as 
-Create new post, 
-View all posts, 
-Edit post, 
-Delete post,
-View all comments
-Delete Comments

More features would be added depending on the amount of time i've got
