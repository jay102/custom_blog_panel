# custom blog panel
A custom blog web app for my personal react website. 
Developed with a TypeScript/JavaScript backend and a React Frontend for Ui and Admin Dashboard.

Database used was postgres and ORM used was sequelize.
It has minimal features such as 
-Create new post, 
-View all posts, 
-Edit post, 
-Delete post,
-Add tags
-Add featured image
-View all comments
-Delete Comments

More features would be added depending on the amount of time i've got
