# custom blog panel
A custom blog web app for my personal react website. 
Developed with a TypeScript/JavaScript backend and a React Frontend for Ui and Admin Dashboard.

I moved the Client folder to another repo here [Client](https://github.com/jay102/personal-blog-client) just to keep it seperate and it was hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) while the backend which is this current repo was hosted on Heroku.

[Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com) was used for image uploads and [Disqus](https://disqus.com) was used for comments

Database used was postgres and ORM used was sequelize.
It has minimal features such as 
-Create new post, 
-View all posts, 
-Edit post, 
-Delete post,
-Drag and Drop image on post
-Add tags
-Add featured image
-Add Media
-Delete Media

More features would be added depending on the amount of time i've got
